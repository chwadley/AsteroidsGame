		    <b>Explanation of settings:</b></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Run into asteroids to break them:</b> the goal is to collide with the asteroids. You cannot use bullets.
		    </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Bullets break asteroids:</b> the goal is to avoid the asteroids. You must use bullets.
		    </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Asteroids break into smaller ones (hard):</b> when breaking an asteroid (either using collision or bullets), it will split into two smaller asteroids, although you'll likely hit those too, creating a small explosion.
		    </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Asteroids immediately disappear when broken (easy):</b> when breaking an asteroid (either using collision or bullets), it will not split, it will just disappear.
		    </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ship moves in the direction you input with WASD:</b> for example, when holding W, the ship will acclerate up regardless of the direction you were previously facing. Or, when holding D, the ship will accelerate right regardless of the direction you were previously facing.
		    </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A/D turns the ship:</b> holding W accelerates in the direction you are facing. A rotates the ship counter-clockwise without accelerating it, B rotates the ship clockwise without accelerating it.
		    </br></br><i>[The following settings will not appear if you choose "Run into asteroids to break them."]</i>
		    </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shoots one bullet at a time:</b> pressing l shoots one bullet. Holding l does nothing.
		    </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Shoots a continuous laser beam:</b> pressing and holding l will shoot a bullet every frame.
